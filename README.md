+ Hello there 👋
+ I really like to code and solve problems 
+ You might catch me sailing or surfing when I'm not programming
~ I'm focused in GO, Javascript | Typescript, and trying new frameworks 🌴
~ I enjoy func programming and distributed systems 🌊
~ Recently I've been learning how to work in low-level, embedded systems 
~ Currently reading "Building Modern CLI Applications in Go"
- I'll annoy you about (neo)vim
- speaking of which, can you try my ***northern*** colorcheme ?
@@ working on distributed systems and cloud computing with GO 👨‍💻  @@
# Thanks for reading !
