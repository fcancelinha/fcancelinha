+ Hello there 👋
+ I really like to code 
+ You might catch me sailing or surfing when I'm not coding
+ also, documentation and testing is important, seriously.
• I'm focused on Go, Typescript, some Lua & C/C++ 🌴
• I enjoy func programming and fast websites 🌊
• Currently reading "Building Modern CLI Application in Go"
- I'll annoy you about (neo)vim
- speaking of which, can you try my ***northern*** colorcheme ?
@@ working on distributed systems and cloud computing with go 👨‍💻  @@
# Thanks for reading !
